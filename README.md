## Licensing rationale

AGPLv1, a derivative of GPLv2 that closes the SaaS loophole, is an excellent licence for the purpose of copyleft. AGPLv2 and AGPLv3, which are based on GPLv3, are a regression from AGPLv1. At [a DebConf 14 Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKIZ7gJlRU), Linus Torvalds briefly explained the unnecessary complications that would hinder copyleft.

The anti-patent provisions of v3 licences are also a gimmick with dubious legal enforceability. I don't need them for such a small project.

**PS** It seems weird for the preamble of a software licence to read like the opening chapter of *The Communist Manifesto*. But the GNU licences mandate its inclusion. ALL HAIL RICHARD STALLMAN, I guess (partially sarcasm).
